# RIPcipts
* We wanted to reduce the time it took to track how much we spent into a budgeting app. We decided to make an app that would serve the same purpose with just a photo of the receipt.

What it does
Users can take photos of their receipts and have the costs of items recorded. It tracks the total amount spent in a period of time and also keeps a history of each individual receipt that was entered.

How I built it
Built using Java in Android Studio and Cloud Vision API to read text from a photo.

Challenges I ran into
Finding a way to open the camera and store images was one of the most time-consuming portions. It ended up being a security issue that was resolved with a few tweaks.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Getting the camera to work!

What I learned
Try EVERY option.

What's next for RIPceipt
To increase the amount of customization that can be done and improve accuracy of categories detected from purchases.
