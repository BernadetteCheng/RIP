### *A budgeting Android appliction prototype focused to eliminate manual inputs to make budgeting and expense tracking easier.*

#### What it does
Users can take photos of their receipts and the costs of each of the items are extracted and recorded. The total amount spent in a period of time is tracked as well as the history of each individual receipt that was entered.

#### How I built it
Built using Java in Android Studio, Cloud Vision API to read text from a photo, as well as the Walmart Open API to decode the item codes.

#### What's next
Increase the amount of customization that can be done and improve accuracy of categories detected from purchases
